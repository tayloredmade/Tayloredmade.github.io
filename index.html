<br>Hello everyone, my name is Amanda Taylor however, I go by "Tay". I was born and raised in Chicago and graduated High School at the age of 17. I then joined Air Force and had to wait until I turned 18 to leave for basic military training. My dream as a kid was never to join the military but, when I saw my cousin in his uniform and what he stood for I knew I had to follow in his footsteps. 16 years later I have been to Minot, ND, South Korea, China, Japan, Australia, Guam, South Carolina, Arizona, Florida, Texas, and now Nevada.</p>
<br>I am a <a href="https://www.airforce.com/careers/detail/personnel" target="_blank">Personnelist</a> in the Air Force or Human Resources in the civilian sector.  However, this has never been something I was interested in but, it does allow me to help people which is something I love doing. I have always been into technology and trying to figure out how it works. I self-taught myself to <a href="https://www.eccouncil.org/ethical-hacking/">Ethical Hacking</a> and trying to figure out computer programming. I also love gaming but more so on the Xbox series X and my new favorite the Oculus Quest 2. I uploaded some Oculus Quest 2 workout gameplay <a href="https://youtu.be/Agcvu7J0mvI">here</a>.</p>
